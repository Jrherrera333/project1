# Pokemon Weather Finder

## The Pokemon Weather Finder website was created to showcase different kinds of Pokemon based on the temperature of a location found through latitude and longitude coordinates. 

## By simply inputting a latitude and longitude, you will be shown a Pokemon based on the temperature and a display of current temperature in fahrenheit by using 4 parameters. A temperature greater than 10 degrees celsius, 20 degrees celsius, 30 degrees celsius or a temperature less than 30 degrees celsius.

## It was created using 2 API's:

 ##    * https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon

  ##   * https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current_weather=true&hourly=temperature_2m,relativehumidity_2m,windspeed_10m
